# Discount System Testing Guide

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures for the discount code system implemented in the Best SAAS Kit V2.

## Test Environment Setup
- Development server running on: http://localhost:3001
- Admin access required for discount management
- Test Stripe account configured
- Database connection established

## 1. Database Schema Testing

### ✅ Verify Database Tables
```sql
-- Check if discount_codes table exists with correct schema
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'discount_codes' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'discount_codes';

-- Check functions exist
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('validate_discount_code', 'increment_discount_usage', 'get_discount_stats');
```

## 2. Admin Interface Testing

### ✅ Admin Access Control
- [ ] Non-admin users redirected from /admin/discounts
- [ ] Admin users can access discount management page
- [ ] Proper navigation item appears in admin sidebar

### ✅ Discount Creation
- [ ] Create percentage discount (e.g., 20% off)
- [ ] Create fixed amount discount (e.g., $10 off)
- [ ] Set expiration dates (future dates only)
- [ ] Set usage limits (optional)
- [ ] Toggle active/inactive status
- [ ] Validate required fields
- [ ] Check duplicate code prevention

### ✅ Discount Management
- [ ] View all discount codes in table
- [ ] Edit existing discount codes
- [ ] Delete discount codes
- [ ] Toggle active/inactive status
- [ ] Copy discount codes to clipboard
- [ ] View usage statistics

### ✅ Form Validation
- [ ] Code length validation (minimum 3 characters)
- [ ] Code format validation (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
- [ ] Discount value validation (percentage 1-100, fixed amount > 0)
- [ ] Expiration date validation (future dates only)
- [ ] Max uses validation (positive numbers only)

## 3. API Endpoint Testing

### ✅ Admin API Routes
```bash
# Test GET /api/admin/discounts
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/admin/discounts

# Test POST /api/admin/discounts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/discounts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "TEST20",
    "discount_type": "percentage",
    "discount_value": 20,
    "max_uses": 100,
    "is_active": true
  }'

# Test PUT /api/admin/discounts/[id]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/admin/discounts/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "is_active": false
  }'

# Test DELETE /api/admin/discounts/[id]
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/admin/discounts/1
```

### ✅ User Validation API
```bash
# Test POST /api/discounts/validate
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/discounts/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "TEST20"
  }'
```

- [ ] Concurrent usage tracking
- [ ] Index effectiveness

### ✅ UI Performance
